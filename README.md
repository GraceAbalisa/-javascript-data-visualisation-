# Objectives

This consolidation challenge was supposed to help us assess our ability to solve a problem inspired from real-life situations using our new javascript muscles involving the following know-hows :

    DOM manipulation
    AJAX/FETCH request
    Using Third-party libraries
    problem-solving : design a logical solution to implement the expected result
    Debugging using the console
    Understand the notion of "separation of concerns"
