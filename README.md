# Objectives

This consolidation challenge was supposed to help us assess our ability to solve a problem inspired from real-life situations using our new javascript muscles involving the following know-hows :

    DOM manipulation
    AJAX/FETCH request
    Using Third-party libraries
    problem-solving : design a logical solution to implement the expected result
    Debugging using the console
    Understand the notion of "separation of concerns"

# The mission

I work in the Multimedia department of one of the European Union institutions. This morning, Johnny Hasnoclew, the Project Manager, sends me on a mission: one of the in-house journalists has published a new article on the institution's website. The article in question is already integrated with an html / css / Javascript file.

He asks to make it more rich, more interactive

That's exactly what I am going to do, by adding two interactive data visualisation graphics using javascript. These graphs will be interactive in the sense that the user can manipulate the graph, such as filtering data, or reveal detailed data when the mouse hovers over it.
